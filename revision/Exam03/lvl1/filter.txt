SUJET 1 :
Allowed functions: read, strlen, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, perror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a programm that will take one and only one argument s.

Your programm will then read from stdin and write all the content read in stdout
except that every occurence of s must be replaced by '*'.

For example :

./filter bonjour
will behave the same way as:
sed 's/bonjour/*******/g'

in case of error during read or a malloc you must write "Error: " followed by
the error message in stderr and return 1.

$> echo 'abcdefgaaaabcdefabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defgaaa***def***

If the program is called whitout argument or with an empty argument or with
multiples arguments it must return 1.

SUJET 2 :
Allowed functions: read, write, strlen, memmem, memmove, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, 
fprintf, stdout, stderr, perror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a programm that will take one and only one argument.

Your programm will then read from stdin and write all the content read in stdout
except that every occurence of s must be replaced by '*' (as many as the length of s). 
Your program will be tested with random buffer sizes, using a custom read function. 
Therefore the buffer being set in your program will be filled with a different number of chars 
each new call.

For example :

./filter bonjour
will behave the same way as:
sed 's/bonjour/*/g'

in case of error during read or a malloc you must write "Error: " followed by New line
the error message in stderr and return 1.

./filter abc
will behave the same way as :
sed 's/abc//g'
More generally your program must be the equivalent of the shell script filter.sh present in this 
directory (you can compare your program with it).


$> echo 'abcdefgaaaabcdefabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defgaaa***def***

$> echo 'ababcabababc' | ./filter ababc | cat -e
ab$
$>

If the program is called whitout argument or with an empty argument or with
multiples arguments it must return 1.
